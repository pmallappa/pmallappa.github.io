<h1 id="secrets">Secrets</h1>

<p>Hiding information from intruders was used as tactics from dawn of civilization.
Earlier days of humanity more and more of the Kings and Queens have used lame
form of encryption just to hide their information from the carriers and other
traitors.</p>

<p>Given the internet and pretty much anyone with an access can look into your
information; it has evidently became important <em>privacy</em> is the at most
important thing on the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>Alice</strong> and <strong>Bob</strong> invented cryptography, <strong>Just KIDDING</strong> all most all the
texts, presentations, blogs and articles talk about these two people wanting to
exchange some secret messages. To have local touch we take names of mythical
creations of <strong>Rama</strong> and <strong>seeta</strong>, I am not going to say anything different,
but present to you with things that I have understood.</p>

<p>Everyone has secrets, so does <strong>Rama</strong> and <strong>Seeta</strong>. How do the communicate
with each other via written media, even if someone get their hands on the secret
message.</p>

<h1 id="computer-security">Computer Security</h1>

<p>Computer security in this article vastly refers to the various levels and
dimensions of all the security involved online. To elaborate, Securing the
physical computer to login password to encrypted disk, encrypted driver,
encrypted folder, encrypted file to encrypted email. In this short-book we
concentrate on the encrypted email part.</p>

<h1 id="e-mail-security">E-mail security.</h1>

<p>E-mail as it stands today was invented in sixties, at the time the network is
limited to a single organization (usually defence) and no one else would have
access to this network as a person has to have physical access.</p>

<p>Once the small network started to grow (what is today commonly refered to as the
<strong>Internet</strong> (with a I)), people started to realize the e-mail is often sent on
the network as a clear text message. Anyone who can tap into the physical
network could see the email sent from one person to another.</p>

<p>This is a obvious security concern, and what lead to the inventions of keys.
Using these keys the <em>cleartext</em> is converted into <em>ciphertext</em>. The ciphertext
is not guaranteed to have same lenght of the original message.</p>

<p>This process of converting from cleartext to ciphertext is known as
<strong>encryption</strong>. The process of converting back from ciphertext to cleartext is
known as <strong>decryption</strong>. There are two types of keys in use</p>

<h3 id="symmetric-keys">Symmetric keys</h3>

<p>Same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages. The problem with this kind of
encryption is that, if a person <strong>A</strong> gets hold of key belonging to <strong>B</strong>, which <strong>B</strong>
is not intended to. <strong>A</strong> can decrypt all the messages that were sent to <strong>B</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="asymmetric-keys">Asymmetric keys</h3>

<p>A pair of keys are used, commonly refered to as <strong>private</strong> key and <strong>public</strong> key.
A <em>public key</em> is available to public and anyone can use this key to send email
to a person to whom this key belongs. And the receiving party uses his/her
<em>private key</em> to decrypt the message.</p>

<h2 id="sample-graph">Sample graph</h2>

<h1 id="pgp-pretty-good-privacy">PGP - Pretty Good Privacy</h1>

<p>It became evidently clear from the beginning that <em>symmetric</em> encryption would
not offer a better infrastructure in terms of security. All the concentration
was directed to <em>asymmetric</em>.</p>

<h2 id="birth-of-pgp">Birth of PGP</h2>

<h2 id="terminologies">Terminologies</h2>

<h3 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h3>

<p>The way asymmetric encryption is used in maintaining confidentiality (i.e. the
privacy of your precious documents) goes something like this: you generate a
‘keypair’ (a pair of keys such that documents encrypted with one can be
decrypted with the other, and vice versa). One of these is your public key, the
other is your private key. So, you share your public key with the world, and
keep your private key, well, private. People who want to send you an encrypted
e-mail find your public key, write the e-mail, encrypt it using the public key
and send it to you. You, on receiving the e-mail, whip out your private key,
decrypt the ciphertext and read it. This is how confidentiality is obtained with
OpenPGP, and it’s relatively simple.</p>

<p>In actual fact, it doesn’t quite work like this. As it happens, and quite
unfortunately so, asymmetric encryption has a few drawbacks. It is quite
computationally intensive, and some algorithms can produce ciphertext up to
twice the size of the original text. For these reasons, a technique known as
hybrid encryption is employed. Rather than just encrypting a document with your
public key, a unique, random session key is generated for that document. This is
also sometimes referred to as a nonce (number used once). The session key needs
to be completely random, essentially ‘unguessable’; this is why having a good
source of randomness (a.k.a. entropy) is very important in system security.</p>

<p>The document is encrypted symmetrically with that session key, and then the
session key is encrypted with your public key. This will probably be much
shorter than the document itself, so the computational load of asymmetric
encryption is lightened significantly. The encrypted session key is attached to
the symmetrically-encrypted document, and the session key discarded forever.
Upon receiving the encrypted document, you use your private key to decrypt the
session key, and then use the session key to decrypt the entire document.</p>

<h3 id="authenticity">Authenticity</h3>

<p>One of the other uses of asymmetric encryption is for verifying the authenticity
of data. For example, how do I know that this e-mail was actually sent to me
from Joe Bloggs and not some impostor? We can take advantage of the fact that,
if one key can decrypt a piece of ciphertext, the other key must necessarily
have encrypted it. First, the sender will take the e-mail and construct a hash
using a cryptographic hash function. This function must have several properties:</p>

<p>It should be impractical to find two distinct messages with the same hash. It
should be impractical to obtain the original message given a hash (a CHF is a
one-way function). It should be easy to compute the hash value for any given
message. The sender then takes that hash and his/her own secret key, and encrypt
the hash with the secret key. This encrypted hash, known as the signature, is
bundled along with the message when it is sent. The recipient can then take the
signature, the original message, and the sender’s public key, and attempt to
decrypt the signature using the public key. The recipient will hash the message
themselves, and compare the decrypted signature to the hash of the message. If
equal, the recipient can know for certain that the message was created by
someone with a certain private key (without knowing the key themselves). This is
how authenticity is obtained using OpenPGP.</p>

<p>It also helps to enforce data integrity, since the hash check will fail if the
document has been changed in transit, so either data corruption or malicious
intent will be detected.</p>

<p>This is usually used in tandem with encryption, providing confidentiality and
integrity, but it’s also pretty useful for things like software releases, where
the maintainer will sign the release file with his/her private key. You’ll
download the release file and the corresponding .sig or .asc file, and verify
that the package was downloaded intact and that it was published by the bona
fide maintainer.</p>

<h3 id="keyservers">Keyservers</h3>

<p>Obviously, if you have your public/private keypair, you’ll want to somehow
publish the public key somewhere where everyone can access it. Keyservers are a
relatively simple way to do so. A keyserver is literally just a repository of
public keys; I’ll show you later how to push to and fetch from a keyserver,
since this is an important way of keeping your keyring (i.e. the public keys of
others you have saved locally) up-to-date, and also keeping others’ keyrings
up-to-date (such as when you make a change to your key).</p>

<p>WEB OF TRUST
One of the most important concepts in OpenPGP is that of a Web of
Trust. Let’s say Alice decides to generate a keypair using your identity (name
and e-mail address). How are people to decide which belongs to who? Not only
might someone send you e-mail encrypted for Alice, rendering you unable to read
it, but Alice could also read that e-mail, constituting a major breach of
security (not to mention a serious inconvenience). Alice could also sign
documents, tricking recipients into thinking that you created them.</p>

<p>Fortunately, using the concept of signing as detailed above, you can sign a
public key, as if to say ‘I trust this key—owner relationship’. The more keys
sign that key, the more that key becomes ‘trusted’. Eventually, you will have
what is known as a ‘Web of Trust’; where key A is signed by key B and C, key B
is signed by keys A and D, and key C is signed by keys A, B and D, for example.
The set of keys and signatures makes up the Web of Trust. You can determine
whether an identity is to be trusted or not by following the chain of trusted
friends. This way, anyone trying to pose as a user will not be able to get much
trust; you’ll always go with the key that works out as most trusted.</p>

<p>I’ll give an example. Let’s say you and Bob are best friends. You trust him
completely, so you’ve signed his key. Bob has a friend called Chris, who he
trusts completely, so he has signed his key. If Chris sends you a signed e-mail,
you’re very likely to believe that signature indeed belongs to Chris, because
the authenticity of the key with which it is signed has itself been attested to
by your best friend Bob (and you can verify that by checking Bob’s signature
against his public key). It can get confusing for even relatively small
networks, but fortunately a simple computer algorithm can calculate a ‘trust
level’ for a given signature, based on following the sequence of connections of
trust linking you to that signature.</p>

<p>You might also be happy to know that OpenPGP is a good reason to have a party.
At key-signing parties, groups of people get together and exchange their key
fingerprints (since each OpenPGP key has a unique identifier); the morning
after, everyone goes online and signs the keys they accepted the night before.</p>

<h1 id="gpg-gnu-privacy-gaurd">GPG - Gnu Privacy Gaurd</h1>

<h2 id="introduction-to-gpg">Introduction to GPG</h2>

<p>There are 3 main flavors of GnuPG:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.4 (AKA gpg) - Old - Super stable (11 years old) &amp; limited features</li>
<li>2.0 (AKA gpg2) - Stable - Most people use this for personal encryption</li>
</ul>

<p>It isrecommended by the GnuPG project version to use the Stable GPG-2 release
(2.0). I&rsquo;ve also included instructions for GnuPG2.1 because I use it personally
and find the new features useful.</p>

<h2 id="terminologies-1">Terminologies</h2>

<h3 id="passphrase">Passphrase</h3>

<p><em>Password</em> is a word, as the name indicates its an &lsquo;elongated&rsquo; password.
According to research, a phrase or a sentence makes it hard to crack a secret key.</p>

<h3 id="subkeys">Subkeys</h3>

<p>Subkeys are quite a subtle but powerful concept. The problem with the keypair is
this: what happens when a key is compromised? You’ll have to revoke your old
keypair (a process which involves you verifying that you are the owner of the
key, after which it will be marked as revoked), thus losing your entire Web of
Trust, and then re-generate a key and publish that. Clearly not a very good
situation to be in.</p>

<p>OpenPGP uses a concept known as a subkey to mitigate this problem. Rather than
have a single keypair, you’ll have a ‘master’ keypair which acts as your
identity, and a ‘subkey’ pair which does the actual *cryption. If for some
reason a subkey pair becomes compromised (i.e. someone finds out your
passphrase), you can revoke just that subkey and create a new one, without
losing your identity or WoT.</p>

<p>Types of Subkeys</p>

<h4 id="master-key">Master Key</h4>

<h4 id="signing-key">Signing Key</h4>

<h4 id="encryption-key">Encryption Key</h4>

<h4 id="authentication-key">Authentication Key</h4>

<h3 id="signing-the-key">Signing the Key</h3>

<p>This is about authorizing a key that its a trusted one. This is particularly

<p>Enable SSH support in GnuPG Agent by adding the corresponding option in the
agent configuration file <span class="underline">~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</span> :</p>

<pre><code>enable-ssh-support
</code></pre>

<p>While GnuPG programs can start the GnuPG Agent on demand, starting explicitly
the agent is necessary to ensure that the agent is running when a SSH client
needs it. The two lines below, to be inserted into a ~/.xprofile script, are
sufficient: gpg-connect-agent /bye</p>

<pre><code>export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$HOME/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh
</code></pre>

<p>With the GPG agent running, you can start using it with your existing SSH keys,
exactly like you would use ssh-agent. For example, to load your default
~/.ssh/id_rsa key into the agent, just run as usual: $ ssh-add Using an OpenPGP
key as a SSH key Create an authentication subkey Let’s assume you already have
an OpenPGP key such as the following (note the &#x2013;expert flag, which will enable
advanced key generation options):</p>

[ultimate] (1). Alice &lt;alice@example.org&gt;
This is a 4096-bit master key with a 2048-bit subkey for encryption and a 2048-bit subkey for signing. We will add a new 2048-bit subkey for authentication purposes:
gpg&gt; addkey
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (5) Elgamal (encrypt only)
   (6) RSA (encrypt only)
   (7) DSA (set your own capabilities)
   (8) RSA (set your own capabilities)
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (11) ECC (set your own capabilities)
  (12) ECC (encrypt only)
  (13) Existing key
Your selection?
Select (8) RSA (set your own capabilities):
Possible actions for a RSA key: Sign Encrypt Authenticate
Current allowed actions: Sign Encrypt

   (E) Toggle the encrypt capability
   (A) Toggle the authenticate capability
   (Q) Finished

<p>Select successively (S), (E), and (A) to remove the signing and encryption
capabilities and enable the authentication capability.</p>

<pre><code>Possible actions for a RSA key: Sign Encrypt Authenticate
Current allowed actions: Authenticate

   (S) Toggle the sign capability
   (E) Toggle the encrypt capability
   (A) Toggle the authenticate capability
   (Q) Finished

</code></pre>

<p>Once the only allowed action is Authenticate, select (Q) Finished to exit this
sub-menu. The remaining of the procedure is like any other key generation:</p>

<pre><code>RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048)
Requested keysize is 2048 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      &lt;n&gt;  = key expires in n days
      &lt;n&gt;w = key expires in n weeks
      &lt;n&gt;m = key expires in n months
      &lt;n&gt;y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 1y
Key expires at Thu 31 Dec 2015 02:02:56 PM CEST
Is this correct? (y/N) y
Really create? (y/N) y

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

<p>Using the authentication subkey To tell the agent that the authentication subkey
can be used with SSH, extract the keygrip of that subkey:</p>

<pre><code>$ gpg2 --with-keygrip -k alice
pub   rsa4096/CB2F38F25B491A54 2014-12-31 [SC] [expires: 2017-12-30]

sub   rsa2048/04BB7F8FDEC5E5D9 2014-12-31 [S] [expires: 2015-12-31]
      Keygrip = 21B2EDF018D7CAF0B45644FDB753DD42307C4425

      Keygrip = ECF4591CC28EC303BB12D1E866C8B8AFFB675C7D
</code></pre>

<p>As can be seen from last few lines the key marked with <span class="underline">[A]</span> is the auth key
and write it into the <span class="underline">~/.gnupg/sshcontrol</span> file:</p>

<pre><code># List of allowed ssh keys.  Only keys present in this file are used
# in the SSH protocol.  The ssh-add tool may add new entries to this
[…]
ECF4591CC28EC303BB12D1E866C8B8AFFB675C7D
</code></pre>

<p>You may then verify that the key is indeed available for SSH by querying the
agent for available identities:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh-add -l
2048 e3:40:d5:eb:ef:b1:3a:37:87:3d:a8:44:1d:81:ed:6a (none) (RSA)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, extract the public key from the agent in a form suitable for inclusion
into a <span class="underline">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span> file:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh-add -L
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAA[…truncated output…]KhJHfdIcCMRF (none)
