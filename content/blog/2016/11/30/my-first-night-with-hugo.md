## What happens in there
Okay, Before it gets any weirder, [**Hugo**](http://www.hugo.com) is a blogging
engine. Write a bunch of files in markdown syntax and **Hugo** will render it
for you. When all is done, and you are _satisfied_, it can be taken to next
step.

## Where to begin
In all the ocean of knowledge, an important question to ask is where the
**Hell** I start ?

There were so many blogging engines, With my initial encounter with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com),
[Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) etc., I thought I may never start.

To my surprise, *Hugo* came to rescue.

## Never thought this would happen
It was a bliss and with a few command strokes my blog is up and running

## Setting up
Much of the information is presented in a better manner on hugo's documents
Please refer that. We discuss setting up a github pages (static content). My
goal is to have a single repository that serves as fully deployed html files
from a `gh-pages` branch.

Another branch say `master` saves all the static contents of this site.

### Setting up hugo
As mentioned above, please refer Hugo's documentation for this
### Setting up your site

`hugo new site <site>`

Where 'site' is the name of the site for your disposal.

### Setting up your categories

It is better to categorize contents that one will write on their pages.

## Writing your first Blog

## Changing your home page
My personal preference is to have a separate home page which doens't right away
thow the blog/ in the visitors face.
